  <h1>Dan Dofter</h1>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a seasoned technologist with over 17 years of experience working with companies primarily in and around Silicon Valley. I craft quality products quickly while helping my clients avoid common pitfalls along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    I consider myself a generalist and have experience with a large number of web and mobile technologies. My most recent work has involved building iOS applications with Swift and web applications with Ruby, Node.js, and React. I'm also interested in spending more time with Go and Python.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm looking for 2-6 month consulting engagements for 20-40 hours per week. I prefer having the flexibility to work remotely but am open to on-site work for clients located in San Francisco.
  </p>

  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I'm most proud of my work at <a href="https://path.com/">Path</a>. I joined the founding team as <b>VP of Engineering</b> where I designed the architecture of their social network, hired and managed the engineering team, and built the majority of the back end of the product. It was a lot of fun. And a lot of work.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recently cofounded a live music startup, <a href="https://sandstorm.fm/">Sandstorm</a>, which I focus on between consulting engagements.
  </p>
