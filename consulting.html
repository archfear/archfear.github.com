  <h1>Dan Dofter</h1>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a seasoned technologist with over 15 years of experience working with companies primarily in and around Silicon Valley. I enjoy using the experience I've gained to help my clients build quality products quickly and efficiently and avoid common pitfalls along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    I consider myself a generalist and have experience with a large number of web and mobile technologies. My most recent work has involved building iOS applications with Swift and web applications with Ruby, Node.js, and React.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm looking for 2-6 month consulting engagements for 20-40 hours per week. I prefer having the flexibility to work remotely but am open to on-site work for clients located in San Francisco.
  </p>

  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I'm most proud of my work at <a href="https://path.com/">Path</a>. I joined their founding team as <b>VP of Engineering</b> where I designed the architecture of their social network, hired and managed the engineering team while building the majority of the back end of the product. It was a lot of fun. And a lot of work.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recently cofounded a live music startup, <a href="https://sandstorm.fm/">Sandstorm</a>, which I focus on between consulting engagements.
